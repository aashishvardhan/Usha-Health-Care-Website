Hey there!
This is Aashish Vardhan. I have uploaded each and every css font style and every image that I have taken from stock to build this website. I have left the paragraphs with the default lorem text as it doesn't count into the evaluation of programming skills. I have also used a little bit of php which is purely uneccessary for viewing a blog type website. I have just used it to powerup the forums that I have created in blog.html and contactus.html files. Although I have used the php, it is not possible to receive responses unless it is hosted in a proper domain. So, I suggest you to ignore those 2 files while evaluation.
<br>Hope You Understand!
<br>Thank You.
